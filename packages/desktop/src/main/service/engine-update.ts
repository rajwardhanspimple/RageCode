/**
 * The free-maintenance half of the engine: fetch a newer engine, prove it before it is allowed near
 * the real data, and give a launch that turns out badly a way back.
 *
 * Three entry points, in the order a launch uses them:
 *
 * - `preferred()` runs synchronously while the CLI is resolved, and answers "is this launch running
 *   the bundled engine or an adopted one".
 * - `confirmBoot()` runs once the sidecar has connected, which is the only proof that the adopted
 *   engine boots inside this app rather than merely inside the sandbox.
 * - `refresh()` runs after the app is up, and is the only part that touches the network. It never
 *   throws and never affects the running session: a new engine that passes its gate is adopted for
 *   the next launch, because swapping the engine under a live sidecar is how a session gets lost.
 *
 * Anything at all going wrong leaves the bundled engine in place. That is the whole design.
