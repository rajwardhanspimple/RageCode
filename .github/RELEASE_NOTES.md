## Ragestar 2.2.8

**Engine updates now have a bouncer.** The app can adopt a newer CLI engine without shipping a
new desktop build, but only after the candidate proves it still serves every route the window
calls. An engine that fails the gate is refused; one that passes but never reaches its sidecar is
rolled back on the next launch.

A provider-agnostic, open-source desktop AI client. Nothing is preconfigured: no provider, no
endpoint in the code, no credential. You connect an account, or you don't.

macOS and Linux packages are built by the release workflow on native runners. They are unsigned;
see the platform notes below.

### What's new
- **Compatibility-gated engine updates.** Once per launch a production build consults npm's
  `latest` dist-tag and may stage a newer engine. The candidate must match the registry's
  `dist.integrity` sha512, boot in a throwaway data directory, report the exact version being
  adopted, serve all 25 operations the window calls, and complete a real create/delete session
  round trip. Additions are allowed; a renamed or dropped route is a refusal.
- **Two-phase commit with rollback.** A staged engine is marked `attempting` when it starts. The
  adoption becomes permanent only when its sidecar connects; a launch that never gets there
  reverts to the bundled engine on the next start and records the rejection, so a broken engine
  is never retried.
- **The pinned engine is gated at build time.** `bun run build` now boots the engine it is about
  to package and refuses the build if that engine has lost a required route.
- **Forward moves only.** Same major, no prereleases, and a `0.x` engine is limited to patch
  moves. `RAGESTAR_ENGINE_UPDATE=off` disables the check.

### Verify before you run
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` carries the SHA-256 for the Windows installer, `latest.yml` and the blockmap.
- Windows installer SHA-256:
  `f554941e2437a0d8643488d543ec082322091e3c9dd054748a806d00f1f41934` (257,956,222 bytes).
- The 2.2.7 installer was scanned at VirusTotal with **0/50 detections** and the application
  binary with **0/68**; those reports are on the
  [checksums page](https://rajwardhanspimple.github.io/RageCode/checksums.html). The 2.2.8 installer
  is pending its first scan.
- The Windows installer is unsigned. SmartScreen asks you to confirm the publisher; check the
  hash against this release before you do.

### Installing this one
- 2.2.7 installs can take this release through the built-in updater. The engine stays at 2.2.6
  until a newer one passes the gate.
- macOS builds are unsigned, so automatic updates are not enabled there; download new versions
  from this page until the app is signed and notarized.
- Linux AppImage installs can check `latest-linux.yml`; deb and rpm installs update through the
  package manager.

### Platform notes
- **macOS:** the app is not notarized. First launch: right-click the app, choose **Open**, then
  confirm. Drag it to Applications from the dmg.
- **Linux AppImage:** `chmod +x Ragestar-2.2.8-x64.AppImage` then run it. The deb and rpm
  packages install the same app for your package manager.
- **Windows:** the installer is per-user and does not require an administrator.

### Notes
- Ragestar is not affiliated with OpenCode. See `NOTICE.md` and `PRESETS.md`.
- The engine is downloaded from npm at build time; the version shipped is listed in the release
  assets.
