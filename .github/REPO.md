## First release body

```markdown
## Ragestar 2.2.7

A privacy-focused desktop AI client. Nothing is preconfigured: no provider, no endpoint in the
code, no credential. A community template gives you one-click setup if you want it.

### Downloads
| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 10/11 x64 | `Ragestar-Setup-2.2.7.exe` |
| macOS Apple Silicon (arm64) | `Ragestar-2.2.7-arm64.dmg` |

| Linux x64 | `Ragestar-2.2.7-x64.AppImage`, `.deb`, `.rpm` |

### Verify before you run
- SHA-256 for every artifact is in `SHA256SUMS.txt` below.
- VirusTotal report: <ADD REPORT URL>
- The Windows installer is unsigned. SmartScreen will ask you to confirm the publisher; check
  the hash against this release before you do.

### What's in it
- Generic client core. No provider domain is compiled into the app.
- Provider add-ons are community data: a shipped starter template you install with one click,
  your own installed entries, or a registry URL you paste into **Add-ons → Load community
  add-ons**. Nothing is fetched until you press Load, and nothing is applied until you press
  Use.
- Multi-lane egress: Direct, WARP, Tor, proxy, with health checks and rotation.
- Per-session workspace, model, and agent isolation.
- Branded Windows installer: license page, desktop shortcut, launch after install.

### Notes
- Ragestar is not affiliated with OpenCode. See `NOTICE.md` and `PRESETS.md`.
- The engine is downloaded from npm at build time; the version shipped is listed in the
  release assets.

## Pinned issue / first-run note

> **Where do the providers come from?**
> Ragestar ships none. Open the model chip in the composer → **Community Templates** → press
> the OpenCode Zen entry to apply its base URL, then paste the key that endpoint accepts
> (`public` for its free tier). For anything else, **Browse community add-ons**, paste a registry
> URL, and pick an entry; or add your own provider id, base URL and token by hand. Applying an
> entry writes one field into `<userData>/engine/config/opencode/opencode.json` and stores no
> credential.
