Ragestar is a modified distribution of the OpenCode desktop application. That derivation is
a licensing fact recorded below and required by the MIT License; it is not an affiliation,
sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by OpenCode or its maintainers.

## What changed from upstream

| Area | Change |
| --- | --- |
| Product identity | Name, application id, icons, splash, wordmark, and visible strings are Ragestar. |
| Design | Four-lane desktop shell, owl mark, own colour tokens and the `ragestar` theme. |
| Egress | Multi-lane egress manager with health checks and rotation, surfaced in the UI. |
| Providers | No provider is configured or selected at launch. Provider endpoints are community data: a shipped template entry, a local file, or a registry URL the user supplies. Nothing is applied until the user presses Use. |
| Branding | No provider domain is compiled into the client; external links point at this project's repository. |
| Updates | The packaged Windows build points its update feed at this repository's releases. Builds packaged without `RAGESTAR_UPDATE_REPO` write no feed. |
| Engines | The bundled CLI engine is consumed from the upstream published package at build time. |

## Engine binary

The application runs an engine binary that is built and published by the upstream project
(`@opencode/cli-*` on npm). It is downloaded during the build rather than committed to this
repository, so every release records the exact engine version it shipped with in
`packages/desktop/resources/opencode-cli.version`.

## Third-party components

The desktop application bundles Chromium and Electron (MIT), and the dependency licenses that
apply to the upstream tree continue to apply here. The in-app About screen carries the
third-party notices dialog.
